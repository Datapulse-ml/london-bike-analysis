# 🚲 London Bike Final Project

## 📌 Overview
The **London Bike Sharing Dataset** provides valuable insights into the bike-sharing system in London, UK.  
This project explores the dataset through **data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization with Tableau**, highlighting trends and patterns in urban mobility.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The project aims to **analyze the number of bicycles rented by hour, season, and year in London**.  
By combining weather conditions, calendar information, and time-related features, the analysis helps uncover the main factors affecting bike usage.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Records:** ~17,000 (January 2015 – January 2017)  
- **Features:**
  - Bike trips (counts per hour/day).
  - Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall).
  - Contextual factors (public holidays, working days, seasons).  

This dataset enables analysis of **commuting patterns, seasonal effects, and weather impact** on bike demand.

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
Steps performed to prepare the dataset:
1. **Checked for missing values** → None found.
2. **Renamed and reformatted columns** for clarity.
3. **Removed inconsistencies and reduced noise**.
4. **Created a clean dataset** for visualization and analysis.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔹 Moving Average of Bike Rentals
- Smooths data and highlights **long-term demand trends**.
- Useful for transportation planners to anticipate demand.

### 🔹 Temperature vs. Wind Speed
- Heatmap showing the effect of weather on bike usage.
- **Ideal condition:** 14.9°C, 10.7 kph wind speed → **631,940 trips**.

### 🔹 Bike Usage by Weather Condition
- **Clear/partly cloudy days:** highest demand.  
- **Rain/snow/storms:** significant drop in usage.

### 🔹 Bike Usage by Hour of Day
- Peak usage at **7:00 AM** and **5:00 PM** (commuting hours).  
- Lowest activity during late-night hours.

## 📈 Dashboard & Visualizations
An **interactive Tableau dashboard** integrates multiple visualizations:
- Bike usage patterns across hours, days, and seasons.
- Weather impact on ridership.
- Peak commuting times.

👉 These insights support **data-driven decision-making** to:
- Optimize bike availability.
- Improve operational efficiency.
- Enhance user experience.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
- Bike usage is strongly influenced by **weather** and **time of day**.  
- **Clear, moderate weather (10–20°C)** encourages higher ridership.  
- Usage peaks during **commuting hours** and declines in adverse weather.  
- Findings can guide **operational planning** and **service optimization** in urban mobility.
